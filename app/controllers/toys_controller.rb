# I will code exactly what that looks like, what attributes to include and the format, etc, in the erb file
#
get "/toys/?" do

  erb :"toys/index"
end

#-- NEW ----------
# my "new" page will be my way of getting a form to fill out for a new item into the Skill table
# I will make form in the erb file, which will evantually, through "create" post that info to the db
#

# end

#-- EDIT ---------
# When I want to edit the details of a specific record, as referenced by its primary ket
# In my erb file I will have an editable form, which will eventually, through "update" post that info to the db
# (probably will look exactly like NEW only with info already in the form ready to be used or edited as needed)

#     in main.rb:    enable :method_override
#     in the edit page under the form action include:
#            <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="patch">
